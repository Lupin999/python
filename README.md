**Encapsulation in Python**
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It is the practice of restricting direct access to some of an object's components to prevent unintended interference and ensure data integrity.

**1. How Encapsulation Works in Python**
In Python, encapsulation is implemented using private and protected access modifiers:

Public Members: Accessible from anywhere.
Protected Members (_single_underscore): Should not be accessed directly but can be overridden in subclasses.
Private Members (__double_underscore): Name-mangled to prevent direct access from outside the class.
